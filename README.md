## About Me

I’m an AI & Computer Science undergrad at the University of Birmingham, passionate about building technology that merges science with creativity. My work spans **Artificial Intelligence**, **Machine Learning**, and **Quantum Computing**, where I explore how computation shapes the universe and how it can empower humans. 🌍

I'm fascinated by **optimization problems**, **quantum-inspired algorithms**, and **intelligent systems**. Whether it's crafting software solutions or narrating tales through podcasts, my work blends technical depth with artistic expression.

🧠 **Core passions!**  
- Hybrid AI-Quantum Systems  
- Space Tech & Astrophysics  
- Applied AI in Scientific Discovery  
- Storytelling for Science Communication  
- Open Source & Community-led Projects
